# Embabi Store Next.js E-commerce

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, set up your environment variables:

1. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Update the `.env` file with your email credentials:
   - For email verification to work, you need to set up a Gmail account with an app password
   - See: https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Email Verification

This project includes email verification for user signup:

1. When a user signs up, they receive a verification code via email
2. The user must enter this code to verify their account
3. After verification, they can log in

If you don't configure email credentials in the `.env` file, the verification codes will be logged to the console instead of being sent via email. This is useful for development.
